# AdventOfCode2022

I completed all of these without looking at other peoples' solutions, maybe 4 or 5 required me to get some extra input to run to fix problems. I improved a few afterward by looking at other peoples' solutions but not many, the majority are relatively unchanged from when I submitted my answer.

A couple of them may take a few minutes to run. Most problems only provide the part 2 solution

I mostly focused on getting an answer as fast as I could so there is not much commenting. View the the problems here: https://adventofcode.com/2022

Sometimes I would preformat the input if I thought it would be faster, I provided the input files in each solution.
